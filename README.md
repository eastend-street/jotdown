<br/>

## Why I created this app
To manage a lot of bookmarks easily. I had been using Chrome bookmark manager but sometimes I couldn't find the bookmark that I was looking for. Also, I wanted to write a note with bookmarks to remember what the bookmarks are, but Chrome bookmark manager doesn't have that. To solve these problems, I made Jot down.
