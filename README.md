## Why I created this app
To manage a lot of bookmarks easily. I have been using chrome bookmark manager but sometimes I can't find the bookmark that I'm looking for. Then I often commented on bookmarks and saved them in Slack to remember what bookmark is, but it's difficult to find it again as well. Jotdown was born to solve these problems.
